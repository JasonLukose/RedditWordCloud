# RedditWordCloudSentimentAnalysis
Reddit Word Cloud and Sentiment Analysis of your subreddit/submission(thread)


## TODO
1. Implement Data Collection (right now, thinking about hot 1000 submissions and respective comments)
    - Set up infra to handle time frame, filtering submissions from start
        to end time (for subreddit option)
2. Data pre_processing (punctuation, stopwords...)
    - use nltk?
    - Stopwords
    - Symbols
3. Filtering and more filtering/ inferring 
4. Start on word cloud / word frequency from data
5. Figure out next steps
