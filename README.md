# SubredditSentimentAnalysis
Sentiment Analysis of your subreddit


## TODO
1. Implement Data Collection (right now, thinking about hot 1000 submissions and respective comments)
    - Set up infra to handle subreddit (1000 hot) or single submission
    - Comments
    - Set up infra to handle time frame, filtering submissions from start
        to end time

2. Data pre_processing (punctuation, stopwords...)
3. Filtering and more filtering/ inferring 
4. Start on word cloud / word frequency from data
5. Figure out next steps
